    "Context: You are a participant in a memory experiment. First, you will be given a list of words to memorized. After that, you will go through and complete a short list of math problems. Later, you will complete a recognition test with test list. Some of the words in the test lists may have appeared in the study list I initially asked you to memorize. Your task is as follows: if you remember seeing a word in the earlier phase of the experiment, label it as \"old.\" If you believe it did not appear in the study list, label it as \"new.\" For words labeled \"old,\" if you have a vivid memory of the actual presentation, mark it with \"K.\" If you are sure the word was presented in the study list but lack the feeling of recalling its actual occurrence, mark it with \"R.\"\n",
